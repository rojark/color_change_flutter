# colorchange

A new Flutter project.
Objective: Develop and design a Flutter mobile application that allows users to change the 
color of objects using a button. After each button click, the corresponding object with its 
updated color and its type should be reflected and stored in Google Cloud Firestore. 
 
App Interface: 
Create a user-friendly interface for the Flutter app. 
Include a button that users can click to change the color of an object and its type. 
Display the object on the screen with its current color. 
 
Color Changes: 
Implement functionality so that when the button is clicked, the color of the object changes. 
The color change should cycle through five predefined colors. 
 
Cloud Firestore Integration: 
Set up a connection to Cloud Firestore. 
Ensure that every time the button is clicked and the object's color changes, the updated 
color and object information are stored in Firestore.
